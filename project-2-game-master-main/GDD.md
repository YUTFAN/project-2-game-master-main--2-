## Game Overview

"Night Of Amnesia" thrusts players into a tale of memory loss and a desperate bid for freedom. Waking up in an eerie hospital with no recollection of your past, player are immediately confronted with a dual challenge: navigating the infinite long corridors filled with intricate puzzles and evading the ever-watchful eyes of a sinister doctor who seems hell-bent on ensuring the player never leave. As the clock ticks down, will the player unravel the mystery of your confinement, or become another lost soul in the annals of the hospital's dark history?

As to truly encapsulate the essence of a "Time survival" game, our game did integrate the element of time not just as a narrative device but as a core gameplay mechanic. Time should be a constant pressure on the player, influencing decisions, strategy, and the overall progression of the game. More detail will be introduced in **game mechanic section**.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Genre**👻

**Primary Genre:** 

- Time Survival Horror

Description: "Night Of Amnesia" is primarily a Time Survival Horror game. This means that while players will experience the atmospheric tension and fear commonly found in horror games, there's an added layer of urgency brought about by a constantly ticking clock. Players must not only navigate the game's challenges but do so within a set timeframe, making every decision and action crucial to their survival.

**Sub-genres:** 

- Puzzle, Adventure

Puzzle: Throughout the game, players will encounter various puzzles that they must solve to progress. These puzzles are intricately woven into the game's narrative and setting, requiring players to think critically and act swiftly.

Adventure: "Night Of Amnesia" also borrows elements from the adventure genre. Players will explore the eerie hospital, interact with objects and NPCs, and piece together the story behind their mysterious confinement.

Inspirations: Drawing inspiration from games like "Amnesia," "Outlast," and "Granny," "Night Of Amnesia" combines the best elements of horror, puzzle-solving, and time-based challenges to create a unique and suspenseful gameplay experience.

4. **Adaptive Antagonist:** The mysterious doctor doesn't just follow a set pattern. He adapts to the player's actions, making each playthrough unique and unpredictable.
5. **Innovative Puzzles:** Drawing from the dual-reality mechanic, puzzles in "Night Of Amnesia" require players to think across both realms, combining clues and items from each to progress.
6. **Atmospheric Design:** The eerie hospital setting, combined with top-notch sound design and visuals, immerses players in a world that's both hauntingly beautiful and terrifying.
7. **Intricate Character Interactions:** NPCs in the game are not just quest givers or obstacles. Interacting with them reveals deeper layers of the story and can even influence the game's outcome.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Story and Narrative**

**Characters**

- Player: A person who wakes up in a mental hospital with no memory of how they got there.
- Doctor: A mysterious figure who seems pleased that the player is taking their medication on time.
- Patients : NPC who can interact with player and trigger certain events.

### **Prologue:**

In the dimly lit confines of an unfamiliar room, players awaken with a jarring sense of amnesia. The only clues to their identity and past are a few white pills and a medical record on a table. The record hints at a forgotten past and a mysterious ailment that has robbed them of their memories.

### **Chapter 1: The Awakening**

The initial interactions teach players the game mechanics. A mysterious doctor enters, urging the player to take their medication. Compliance leads to praise, but the true objective becomes clear: escape. A key left carelessly by the doctor becomes the first puzzle, teaching players about stealth and the importance of timing. Using a wire found in the room, players fashion a makeshift key, unlocking the door and their first taste of freedom.

### **Chapter 2: Dual Realities**

Emerging into a corridor, players encounter a child NPC who dismisses them curtly. As they progress, the environment subtly shifts, introducing the mirrored reality mechanic. This alternate world is a distorted reflection of the real one. Players must navigate between these realities, interacting with the mirrored NPC to unravel the mystery of the looping corridor. The climax of this chapter centers around a card game with the NPC, where the key to progression is found in the mirrored world: a flying card.

### **Chapter 3: The Surgery of Truth**

Armed with the flying card, players delve deeper into the mirrored world, arriving at a surgery room. Here, they find a doctor, eerily inert, his face obscured by a mask. Interacting with the mask allows players to toggle between realities. A Morse code puzzle, hinted at by flashing lights, becomes the central challenge. Solving it by combining clues from both realities rewards players with a surgical knife, a tool and weapon for the final confrontation.

### **Final Chapter: Breaking the Loop**

The climax is a tense cat-and-mouse chase in the looping corridor. The doctor, now an active threat, hunts the player. Using the corridor's looping nature and the surgical knife, players must outwit and ultimately confront their pursuer. Upon defeating the doctor, a momentary sense of victory is felt. However, a twist reveals that the true antagonist is the child NPC from Chapter 2, suggesting deeper layers to the narrative and setting up potential sequels or expansions.

### **Epilogue:**

The game concludes ambiguously. Did the player truly break free from the loop, or are they trapped in an endless cycle of amnesia and pursuit? The narrative leaves room for interpretation, encouraging discussions and theories among the player community.

Throughout "Night Of Amnesia," the narrative intertwines with gameplay mechanics, ensuring that story progression feels organic. The dual realities not only serve as a gameplay challenge but also symbolize the fragmented state of the player's memory. The looming time mechanic, ever-present, adds urgency to the narrative, reinforcing the themes of survival and the fleeting nature of memory.

## **World Design**

Actual game map looks like updated in 8/10/2023

![world design](Images/world%20design.png)

**Game World**🌏
The game is set in a 3D mental hospital room with minimal furniture. We plan to set the game to achieve some kind of infinite loop, where player infact can never escape from this mental hospital, where we've plan to set the map as a circle where when the player walks from one end of the corridor to the other, player will realize they were just entering the same space.

<p align="center">   <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdHp3dzJ1Z2V0d3hwZjkxZHNxdmZmZWZmaGxrOHl5OTdxeXNjdWFlNiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/Iw0xTmspnTCUOjmCK9/giphy.gif" width="300"> </p>

![firstroom](Images/firstroom.png)

**Objects:**

- **Table**: The only table in the room contains the first clue about why the player is there and what they must do to escape.![Horror game 3D Models | CGTrader](https://img-new.cgtrader.com/items/4518639/8221ab6388/grid/silver-rose-kitchen-collection-3d-model-8221ab6388.jpg)

- **Bed**: Serves as the respawn point for the player each time they "wake up."

- **NPC**: The mysterious figure stands patiently, shrouded in dim light. Their features are hard to discern, adding to their enigmatic presence. Their eyes, however, are fixated on the player, awaiting their move.

**Lighting:** The room is dimly lit, with a single overhead light casting a focused glow on the table, making the card game the center of attention. The rest of the room fades into semi-darkness, with the corners and edges shrouded in shadows, adding to the room's mysterious ambiance.

**Ambiance:** The room is silent except for the soft shuffling of cards and the occasional creak of the wooden floor. The air is thick with tension, as the player realizes the importance of the game they're about to play.

---------------------

3. **The Corridors**
   The corridors are narrow, dimly lit, and confusing, designed to disorient the player. Sounds of footsteps or distant screams occasionally echo.

2. ~~Vomiting Sounds: To make the act of purging more visceral.~~
3. ~~Alarm Sounds: Heard during specific events to heighten tension.~~
4. ~~Lock-Picking Sounds: When the player is using tweezers to pick a lock.~~
5. ~~Getting Out of Bed: To signify the player's 'rebirth' in the game.~~

#### **Final stage design**

Back ground music used was download from unity asset

Pixel sound effect was added for each dialogue 

Morse code sound effect was added for player to better track the passcode in the final scene

#### **User Interface (UI) Sounds**

Special sound effects are assigned to UI interactions to make the interface more engaging:

1. Opening the Backpack: A zipper or velcro sound to signify the action.
2. Storing or Retrieving Items: A soft thud or click to denote the act.



----------------------

## **User Interface (UI)**

The UI will include an inventory screen, a red dot pointer indicating the sight for player, and red dot will change when player point into something that can be interact with.

In order to make player less confuse and make the game easier to play, we've also add a simple shader effect to highlight the item player chose （white pill become red when pointed）

### **Inventory System: Quick-Access Item Bar**

Rather than a traditional backpack or inventory screen, the game employs a quick-access item bar similar to that in Minecraft. This feature is designed for rapid, real-time item use.

### **Our item bar**:

### **Functionality:**

- Limited Slots: The quick-access bar has a limited number of slots to hold items. This forces the player to make strategic decisions about what to carry.
- Real-Time Access: Items can be used directly from the quick-access bar without navigating through multiple menus, making it easier to react quickly to in-game events.
- Backpack status: the left side of the inventory bar has a small icon indication whether or not the inventory bar is open/close.

### **Interactions:**

- Tap to Select: Players tap the item slot in the inventory bar to quickly select items.
- Instant Use: The selected item can be used instantly by clicking a left click button, allowing for quick and timely actions in stressful situations.

### **Item Descriptions:** 

When an item was interact by player, a small tooltip will appear, providing a brief description of the item and its usage.

**Example:**

```
Iron Wire: This wire looks like it can be easily bend into other shapes

White Pill:A white pill, it looks ordinary, but I don't think anyone would want to swallow it.
```

### **Main Menu**

- #### **Components:**

  - Start: To start a new gameplay session.
  - Background animation : To drag player's attention into the game

### **Art Style:**

#### **Design since Project 1**

1. Aesthetic: The UI maintains the game's art style, focusing on a horror atmosphere. The buttons might have a distressed, aged look, and the background could be a dimly lit room or corridor in the asylum.

2. Font: A slightly jagged, distressed font to go along with the horror theme.(Example provide below)

#### **Design update in project 2**

The overall UI now follows a pixel style with the title still focusing on horror atmosphere, dialogue in pixel font and sound effect will provide more retro and RPG type of vibe to let player focus more in the game content and not breaking the horror theme in the same time. 

In addition, we made the start menu in animation for better fit in the endless corridor theme of our game.

## **Technology and Tools**

**Game Engine**:

- **Unity**: The game will be developed using Unity, as it provides a powerful and flexible platform for game development and is compatible with WebGL.

**Asset Libraries**:

- **Unity Asset Store**: For sourcing pre-made assets that fit within the game's aesthetic.
- **Sketch fab**

**Version Control**:

- **Github**: For version control and collaborative work.

**3D Modeling**:

- **Blender**: For creating custom 3D models and animations.
- **Maya**

**Music and Sound Design**:

- Unity asset store
- Free music resource from Youtube

## **Possible Challenges**

**Storage Limitations**

- **Asset Size**: Given that the game will run in a web browser, there's a need to keep the overall file size as small as possible to ensure quick load times.
- **Solution**: Carefully select and possibly compress high-quality assets. Regularly test the game to make sure it stays within the acceptable size limits.

**Timeframe Limit**

- The game was designed to let normal player escape in 5min, however, player time would be difficult to control as different player with have different play time, as we have small quiz and puzzle to solve.

**Work integration**

- It is hard to integrate our game project in Github when multiple teammate during the development process the game, the Github require constant merge conflict and issues and significantly drag down the efficiency of our project development. 

**Design process**

- Due to the technical issues, it is hard to maintain both rationale and entertain player at the same time, there could be many potential bug issues arise during play time.
