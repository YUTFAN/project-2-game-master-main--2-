GameTitle: Night of Amnesia
GameBlurb: You find yourself awakening with no memory of who you are or how you arrived. Night Of Amnesia plunges players into the depths of fear in a relentless quest for escape. As you manoeuvre through gloomy therapy rooms, shadowy hallways and surgical suites, your path is mired in complex puzzles and enigmatic obstacles. Each challenge overcome is a step closer to freedom.Yet, you are not alone. A mysterious doctor prowls the facility, his sole mission being to ensure you never depart from the hospital. As the main antagonist, he is the embodiment of your fears. Avoiding his watchful gaze and sinister intentions is paramount to survive. A major factor in the gameplay is the looming time limit for each challenge. The time limit creates an atmosphere of tension, forcing quick thinking and decision-making. Lean heavily on your wits, reflexes, and intuition. Night Of Amnesia is not just about escape but also survival. The game melds heart-pounding encounters with the doctor and cerebral challenges to create a unique, spine-chilling gameplay experience. One thing is certain - the hospital wants to keep its secrets, and you are its latest. The exit beckons. Can you make it through the night?
